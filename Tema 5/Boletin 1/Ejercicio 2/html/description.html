            <p>General aviation (GA) is defined by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) as all civil aviation aircraft 
                operations with the exception of commercial air transport or aerial work, 
                which is defined as specialized aviation services for other purposes. 
                However, for statistical purposes ICAO uses a definition of general aviation which includes aerial work.</p>
